I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [CVML group](https://cvml.comp.nus.edu.sg/) of the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/). Before joining NUS, I earned both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the [VIPL research group](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/en/index.php) of the [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT)](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), under the guidance of [Prof. Xilin Chen](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xlchen?language=en) and [Prof. Ruiping Wang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/homepage/rpwang/index.htm). 

<!-- I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Technology from UCAS in 2019 and completed a student exchange program in Computer Science at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in 2018. -->

My research interests encompass the field of Computer Vision, with a particular emphasis on Human Pose Estimation during my Ph.D. Previously, during my Master's studies, I explored the incorporation of semantic knowledge in Few-Shot Learning.

<!-- I am also interested in Robotics where I have some experience in using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and [PyRobot](https://pyrobot.org/). -->
